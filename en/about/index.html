            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p><strong>SwimAnalytics</strong> brings professional-grade performance tracking to every swimmer. We believe that advanced metrics like Critical Swim Speed (CSS), Training Stress Score (TSS), and Performance Management Charts shouldn't be locked behind expensive platforms or require complex coaching software.</p>

                <h3>Albert Arno</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-md">Creator & Lead Developer</p>

                <p class="mb-md">
                    Albert is a software developer and former competitive swimmer with over 15 years of Masters swimming experience. After struggling to find affordable, science-based swim analytics tools that weren't tied to specific hardware or cloud platforms, he created SwimAnalytics.
                </p>

                <h4 class="mt-lg mb-sm">Background & Expertise:</h4>
                <ul class="mb-md">
                    <li><strong>15+ years competitive swimming</strong> - Masters swimmer specializing in middle-distance freestyle</li>
                    <li><strong>MSc Computer Science</strong> - Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya</li>
                    <li><strong>iOS Development</strong> - 8+ years building native Swift/SwiftUI applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Sports Science Research</strong> - Deep study of swimming physiology, lactate threshold testing, and training load quantification</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Privacy Advocate</strong> - Committed to local-first, privacy-preserving software</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="mt-lg mb-sm">Why SwimAnalytics Was Created:</h4>
                <p class="mb-md">
                    "After years of using various tracking platforms, I was frustrated by three recurring problems: expensive subscriptions, vendor lock-in requiring specific devices, and lack of control over my own data. I wanted a tool that calculated CSS and TSS correctly, worked with any Apple Health-compatible device, and kept my data private. When I couldn't find it, I built it."
                </p>

                <p class="mb-md">
                    "SwimAnalytics is the app I wish I had when I was training for my first sub-1:10/100m CSS. It combines rigorous sports science (based on Wakayoshi's CSS research and Coggan's TSS methodology) with modern iOS design and complete data privacy."

            <h3>Our Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Science First:</strong> All metrics based on peer-reviewed research. We cite our sources and show our formulas.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> 100% local data processing. No servers, no accounts, no tracking. You own your data.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Agnostic:</strong> Works with any Apple Health compatible device. No vendor lock-in.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Open formulas, clear calculations, honest limitations. No black box algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Advanced metrics shouldn't require a degree in sports science. We explain concepts clearly.</li>
